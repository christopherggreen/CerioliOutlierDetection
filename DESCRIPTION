Description: Implements the iterated RMCD method of Cerioli (2010)
	for multivariate outlier detection via robust Mahalanobis distances. Also
	provides the finite-sample RMCD method discussed in the paper, as well as 
	the methods provided in Hardin and Rocke (2005) <doi:10.1198/106186005X77685> 
	and Green and Martin (2017).
